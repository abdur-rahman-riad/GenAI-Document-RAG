## Project Description
**VOID is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Streamlit, LangChain, ChromaDB, HuggingFace Embeddings, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. It allows users to upload PDF documents, automatically extract and process the content using OCR technology, convert it into searchable vector embeddings, and then ask natural language questions about the document. The system provides accurate, context-aware answers based strictly on the uploaded document content.**
